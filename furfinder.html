                <p>
                    Pets are part of our lives and part of our family. Lost pets is a very sensitive topic to ALL pet owners.
                    In order to relieve the stress and to stop the worry, our team went on a mission to design a mobile app!
                </p>
                <h4>Background & Research</h4>
                <p>
                    We created a questionnaire of possible scenarios and asked pet owners of their needs and worries to determine common behaviour patterns.
                    We found that most of the pet owners value their community and want to get to know other pet owners in the area: to have a local support group.
                    We also found how important it is for pet owners to be connected with this community on a daily basis and to be able to alert them of a lost pet, if needed.
                </p>
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    With this information in hand we defined the ultimate problem:
                    <div class="accent">How can we efficiently and quickly reunite lost pets with their families?</div>
                </p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    We created a mobile app initial design with the following functionality:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to give pet owners opportunity to get to know their community</li>
                    <li>to provide necessary information about local veterinary clinics, animal shelters, pet training facilities, pensions, etc.</li>
                    <li>to be able to report a lost</li>
                    <li>to be able to report a found pet</li>
                    <li>to view all found or lost pets reported through our app</li>
                </ul>
